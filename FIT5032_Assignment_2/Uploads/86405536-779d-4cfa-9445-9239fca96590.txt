**Preventing SQL Injection (Continued)**

In our mission to secure our web applications from SQL Injection attacks, let's explore three vital practices that can enhance our defense:

**1. Stored Procedures:**

- **Encapsulate SQL Logic:** Utilize stored procedures to encapsulate SQL logic.
- **Parameterized Calls:** Ensure parameterized calls to stored procedures to prevent injection attacks.
- **Avoid Dynamic SQL:** Minimize the use of dynamic SQL to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.



**2. Web Application Firewall (WAF):**

- **Monitor and Filter:** Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to monitor and filter incoming traffic.
- **Protective Barrier:** The WAF acts as a protective barrier, inspecting and filtering requests before they reach our application's servers.
- **Detect and Block:** It effectively detects and blocks SQL injection attempts, adding an extra layer of security.


**3. Regular Security Audits:**

- **Assess Vulnerabilities:** Conduct frequent security audits and penetration testing to assess our application's vulnerabilities.
- **Proactive Approach:** Identifying weaknesses early on allows us to address them proactively and avoid potential breaches.
- **Stay Informed:** Stay up-to-date with the latest security best practices to ensure our defenses are robust and adaptive to changing threats.

By implementing these measures, we strengthen our defense against SQL Injection attacks, safeguarding our applications and data from potential exploitation.
